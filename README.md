**Abstract**

Over the last decades, complex deep neural networks have revolutionized Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) research. These models can now achieve impressive performances on various complex tasks like recognition, detection and image semantic segmentation, achieving accuracy close to, or even better, than human perception. However, these neural networks require to be both deep and complex and this complexity constitutes a danger for the safety veriﬁcation (certiﬁcation) and interpretability of a neural network model.

This project explores the certiﬁcation properties of complex neural networks by taking them into ”shallow waters”. First, a detailed investigation of efﬁcient model distillation techniques is conducted. Then, using the shallow models trained with these distillation methods, several of their properties are further explored, among them adversarial robustness and their performance under parameter reduction procedures. Finally, by combining network’s convex relaxation with model compression, the certiﬁcation area of shallow student models (derived from either normally or robustly trained teacher networks) is researched. Through all of these experimental results, it is empirically demonstrated and proved that model distillation leads to shallow models with larger certiﬁcation areas than their equivalent complex teacher networks. Therefore, based on this thesis evidence, shallow distillated networks constitute a possible solution to the safety and interpretability issues that modern complex Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) models face.
